# Retrospective Plans

A summary of two approaches to retrospectives.

## Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel

In this plan a circle divided into five sectors is used, each sector representing one subject in the plan’s name. The facilitator asks 
the team for feedback on each sector: What should the team start doing, stop doing, continue doing, and what should the team 
do more and less. The categories don’t have to be processed in order so speaking freely is encouraged. Duration is between 10 to 
25 minutes.

## Glad, Sad, Mad
Team members write observations or issues on index cards which are then placed on a whiteboard into one of the three 
namesake categories, grouping similar issues into one. The cards are then voted on (usually max. five votes per team member), 
after which they are discussed in descending order. The facilitator ensures that discussion is focused on actions that can be taken 
in the next sprint. The retrospective ends when there are no more cards or after 60 minutes - whichever comes first.
